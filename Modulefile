summary 'Module to install and configure bigfix agents and realy's'
description 'This module is intended to fully automate the process of installing bigfix agents and relays on CentOS and Debian. As per IBM relays are currently supported only on CentOS, agents have been tested and verified on both CentOS and Ubuntu. Unfortunately at this time due to the nature of distribution and reliance upon DB2 puppetizing the bigfix server isn't an option.'
